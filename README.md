# Text Translation Summarization
It's an AI tool I built from scratch that translates Hindi text into English and then summarizes it. It's all about breaking down language barriers and making loads of information easier to digest. Let's dive into what this project is all about:

## Overview
1. Purpose: Tackle the challenge of translates Hindi text into English and then summarizes it.
2. Technology: Utilizes advanced AI models for accurate text translation and concise summarization.

## Project Structure
1. ClientApp.py: The Flask web application interface for real-time operations.
2. TransNdSumm.py: Core script for translation and summarization, demonstrating functionality in a scriptable environment.
3. Index.html: User-friendly front end for a smooth interaction experience.

## Dependencies
1. Flask: Web framework for the application.
2. googletrans: Library for translation tasks.
3. transformers (Hugging Face): For leveraging the BART model in summarization.

## Setup and Usage
1. Installation: Involves setting up Python libraries and running the Flask app.
2. Operation: Users can upload Hindi text for translation and summarization via web interface or script.

## Example
1. Usage Scenario: Uploading a Hindi news article results in instant translation and summarization, showcasing practical utility.

## Credits
1. Acknowledgements: Utilizes open-source tech like Google's Translate API, Hugging Face's Transformers, and Flask.
2. Community Contribution: Builds upon the work of the broader open-source community.

## Challenges
1. Translation Quality: Ensuring translations maintain original text nuances.
2. Summary Coherence: Generating relevant summaries across diverse topics and content types.

## Solutions
1. Model Optimization: Selected BART for its summarization efficacy and googletrans for reliable translations.
2. Testing and Tuning: Extensive validation to meet the project's accuracy and coherence standards.
